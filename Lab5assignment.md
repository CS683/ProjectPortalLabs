# Lab 5
Modify your lab4 to implement the following features. You can choose either 1 or 2 or 3. Be aware that AsyncTask and IntentService are deprecated in API 30 now.
1. Implement Database Operations in AsyncTasks. 
Module 5 shows you an example of using AsyncTask to list projects. Implement a database operation such as updates in AsyncTask as well. 
2. Implement Database updates in an IntentService.
Instead of using an AsyncTask, create an intent service to implement database updates when the user edits the project information.
3. Implement Database updates in a JobIntentService.
Create a JobIntentService to implement database updates when the user edits the project information.
4. Communicate with UI  (optional)
When the update is done, display a toast message to show the update is successful.
